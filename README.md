# Java Drawing App

This is a basic Java Drawing application using the Swing framework, using Java SE 7 and later. The functionality and interface borrow heavily from the original [MacDraw for Apple Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacDraw), though the ideas for vector drawing tools are pretty much the same from [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (an open source alternative to Adobe Illustrator) to [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software).

## Created on Visual Studio Code

I've created this in Microsoft's free Visual Studio Code editor with free Java extensions as described in the [Java in VSCode web page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java). Please install the extensions as described before attempting to run the app. 

Simply open the folder that is the root of the git project into Visual Studio Code and it will find everything and compile them for you. The easiest way to start running or debugging the app is to find the public static main in App.java and right above the function will be links to Run and Debug. Click on those and you're off and running.

The code _may_ run as written on other Java IDEs, but that hasn't been tested and isn't supported as part of this project.
