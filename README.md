# Java App Starter

This is a basic Java app using the Swing framework, using Java SE 7 and later. This basic framework is for anybody who wants to create simple graphics applications in a very basic window.

I've borrowed basics from [tutorials found on www.zetcode.com](www.zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial) and I thank them heartily.

## Created on Visual Studio Code

I've set created this in Microsoft's free Visual Studio Code editor with free extensions as described in the [Java in VSCode web page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java). Please install the extensions as described before attempting to run the app. 

Simply open the folder that is the root of the git project and VSCode will find everything and compile them for you. The easiest way to start running or debugging the app is to find the public static main in App.java and right above the function will be links to Run and Debug. Click on those and you're off and running.

The code _may_ run as written on other Java IDEs, but that hasn't been tested and isn't supported as part of this project.
